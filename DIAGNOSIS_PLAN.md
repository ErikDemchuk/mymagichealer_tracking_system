# Deep Dive Diagnosis Plan: Why Chats Aren't Being Saved

## Problem Summary
- Chats table is empty (verified via SQL query)
- Authentication is working (verified via logs)
- No database insert attempts are being made

## Root Cause Analysis

### Likely Issues (in order of probability):

1. **Environment Variables Not Set in Vercel**
   - The Supabase client is initialized at build time in `src/lib/supabase.ts`
   - If `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are not set in Vercel production, `supabase` will be `null`
   - This means all database operations silently fail and fall back to localStorage

2. **Client-Side Session Not Available**
   - The `useChatStorage` hook creates a NEW Supabase client on the client side
   - This client may not have access to the session cookies set during login
   - The session cookies are set server-side, but the client-side client doesn't have them

3. **RLS Policy Issues**
   - Even though we created policies, they might not be working
   - The policies might be blocking because `auth.uid()` returns null

## Plan to Fix

### Step 1: Verify Supabase Client Initialization
**Action**: Add logging to see if Supabase is configured
**File**: `src/lib/supabase.ts`
**Change**: Add console.log to show if supabase client is null

### Step 2: Fix Session Storage
**Problem**: Client-side code can't read cookies set server-side
**Solution**: Use Supabase's SSR helper to create authenticated client
**File**: Create new client-side Supabase helper

### Step 3: Add Debug Logging
**Action**: Log every step of chat creation
**Where**: In use-chat-storage.ts and chat-interface.tsx

### Step 4: Test and Verify
**Action**: Create chat, check logs, verify in database

## Execution Plan

1. Fix Supabase client initialization to use authenticated session
2. Add comprehensive logging
3. Deploy and test
4. Check Vercel environment variables
5. Verify in database
