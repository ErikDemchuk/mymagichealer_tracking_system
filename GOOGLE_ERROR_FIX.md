# üêõ Google OAuth Error Fix

## ‚ùå **Error You're Seeing:**
```
"Can't continue with google.com - Something went wrong"
```

## üîç **Root Cause:**

The `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` environment variable was added to Vercel **AFTER** the build completed. In Next.js, variables starting with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are **baked into the JavaScript bundle at build time**, not loaded at runtime.

## ‚úÖ **The Fix:**

### **Option 1: Trigger a Redeploy (Easiest)**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/erik-demchuks-projects/production-tracking
2. Click **"Deployments"** tab
3. Find the latest deployment
4. Click the **"..."** menu ‚Üí **"Redeploy"**
5. Wait ~2 minutes for build to complete

This will rebuild your app with the environment variables properly included.

---

### **Option 2: Force a New Deployment (Alternative)**

Make a small change and push to trigger automatic deployment:

```bash
cd production-tracking
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger rebuild with env vars"
git push
```

Vercel will auto-deploy with the environment variables.

---

## üìã **Verify Environment Variables Are Set:**

Go to: https://vercel.com/erik-demchuks-projects/production-tracking/settings/environment-variables

You should see these 4 variables:

1. ‚úÖ `STORAGE_MONGODB_URI`
2. ‚úÖ `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` ‚Üí `293328947211-6uc16de0smqrlo9gqruh7phv6f80936.apps.googleusercontent.com`
3. ‚úÖ `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` ‚Üí `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`
4. ‚è≥ `SESSION_PASSWORD` ‚Üí `7xK9mP2nQ5vL8wR4tY6zA3bN1cF0dH9j`

If `SESSION_PASSWORD` is missing, add it now!

---

## üß™ **After Redeploy, Test:**

1. Visit: https://production-tracking-kssyfmfdo-erik-demchuks-projects.vercel.app
2. Open browser DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Console tab
3. Click "Get Started"
4. Click "Continue with Google"

### **Expected Console Output:**
```
Initializing Google Sign-In with client ID: 293328947211-6uc16de0smqrlo9gqruh7phv6f80936.apps.googleusercontent.com
Google callback received
Google login successful: your-email@gmail.com
```

### **If You See:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID is not set
```
‚Üí The environment variable wasn't included in the build. Redeploy again!

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Google Cloud Console Check:**

Make sure your **Authorized JavaScript origins** in Google Cloud Console includes:

‚úÖ `https://production-tracking-kssyfmfdo-erik-demchuks-projects.vercel.app`

Or better yet, use your custom domain if you have one:

‚úÖ `https://production-tracking-erik-demchuks-projects.vercel.app`

The URL in the browser must **exactly match** one of your authorized origins!

---

## üö® **Common Issues:**

### **1. "redirect_uri_mismatch"**
‚Üí Remove old Supabase redirect URIs from Google Cloud Console

### **2. "invalid_client"**
‚Üí Client ID or Secret is wrong

### **3. "NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID is not set"**
‚Üí Redeploy after adding the env var

### **4. "origin_mismatch"**  
‚Üí Add your Vercel URL to Authorized JavaScript origins

---

## üéØ **Quick Checklist:**

- [ ] `SESSION_PASSWORD` added to Vercel env vars
- [ ] All 4 environment variables are set
- [ ] Redeploy triggered
- [ ] Build completed successfully
- [ ] Authorized JavaScript origins include your Vercel URL
- [ ] Old Supabase redirect URIs removed
- [ ] Browser console shows client ID when logging in

---

## üîÑ **Timeline:**

1. **Now:** Environment variables are set in Vercel
2. **After redeploy (~2 min):** Variables are baked into the app
3. **After test:** Google login should work!

---

## ‚ú® **What I Added:**

- ‚úÖ Better error logging in console
- ‚úÖ Check if client ID is missing
- ‚úÖ User-friendly error messages
- ‚úÖ More detailed console logs

Open browser DevTools to see exactly what's happening!
